# Goal
We use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California.

# Data
The original dataset from Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. "Sparse spatial autoregressions." Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.

# Usage

1 Clone the repo: ''' $ git clone https://github.com/aham225/HousingPricePredictor '''
2 Install necessary packages from "requirements.txt": '''$ pip install -r requirements.txt'''
3 Run the notebook OR directly load the learned model: '''$ python3 tree_reg_loaded = joblib.load("tree_reg.pkl")'''
